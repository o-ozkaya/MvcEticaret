This is almost the first I felt like I'm actually able to do a few things. I will try to come back here improve this even though I'm not gonna publish it anywhere. With this, I'm aiming to scale the impacts of my education.

List of the changes that comes to my mind I'm aiming to make in near future:
1. Remove unused / unnecessary objects
2. Add the "Cart"
3. Real time calculating for the prices in Bitcoin
4. Login
